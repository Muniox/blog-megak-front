## General info

I created a blog on JavaScript as a project for completion for the following reasons:

- Showcase Skills: Creating a blog about JavaScript allows me to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in JavaScript programming, web development, and related technologies.

- Personal Interest: JavaScript is a popular and widely used programming language for web development, and I have a keen interest in learning and exploring its various aspects.

- Relevance to Course/Subject: The project is relevant to the course or subject for which I am seeking completion, as it aligns with the curriculum or learning objectives related to JavaScript or web development.

- Practical Application: Creating a blog on JavaScript provides a practical application of the concepts and techniques learned during the course, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.

- Creative Expression: Designing and developing a blog allows me to exercise my creativity and express my ideas, thoughts, and coding skills in a practical and visually appealing manner.

Overall, creating a JavaScript-focused blog as a project for completion allows me to demonstrate my skills, apply theoretical knowledge, and express my creativity, while aligning with the course requirements.

## Demo

Here is a working live demo: https://blog.truemuniox.usermd.net/

## Technologies/frameworks/libraries used on front-end side of project

- TypeScript
- React

## What has been accomplished on the front-end

- Authentication (React Context)
- Authorization (JWT TOKEN)
- Routing
- Responsive web design (mobile first)
- Fetch posts data and show on Home page
- Filter posts by category on Home page
- Sanitize output from backend on front-end using "dompurify" package
- Integration with simple rich text editor
- User can create post
- User can edit his own post
- User can delete his own post
- Implementation of pages using React and Tailwind (Home, Login, Register, Single, Write)

## What has not been accomplished on the front-end

- Errors only apper in console (modal should be implemented to show errors)
- Serch input that should find posts by name not work
- User can't change avatar (default avatar for all users)
- There is no implementation of a user interface to edit their own data.
- There is no implementation of a admin interface to CRUD user data.
- Implementation of missing pages using React and Tailwind (About, Contact)
- No loaders
- No costom 404 page for routing

## How to run client

To run client localy on pc, file .env.development should have variable:
